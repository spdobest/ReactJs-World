# Diving Deeper into Components and ReactJs Internals

## How do debug React application
- If there is few error, it will show the error in console with line number and error message.
- Sometime due to logical error, you will not be able to check the error
- To track this error, you can put break point in source code in console of the browser
- **React Dev Tool**
  - It is used to show the details of the data in the page
  - When you will move mouse over the component in the webpage , you will see the props values in each component.
  - GO to this link **https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools**
  - Add the extension to chrome
  - You will see another tab named **react** beside console tab in inspect page
## Deeper diving into the React Internals
- In this tutorial, i will cover these topics
   - 1. Better project structure
   - 2. Splitting App into component
   - 3. Stateless vs stateful component comparison
   - 4. Class based vs Functional Component
   - 5. Component Lifecycle
   
## Better Project Structure
  - App.js is a component which contains other logic like rendering list of person
  - A container should not render all these things.
  - We can move that logic to another component named persons.js
  - The folder structure should be like this
  - **src**
    - **assets** - It will contains all images and fonts etc
    - **component** - It will contain all the components
      - **person** - This will comtain specific components related to person
    - **container**
      - App.js, App.css
   - **Cockpit**
    - Cockpit.js
- To see the project stucture and how to manage code please follow the project **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/17structureProject**   

### Comparing Stateless and Statefull components
- A component which maintain state is known as Statefull component
- A class based component by default known as statefull component unless it maintains a state
- A functional component can be also statefull component if it maintains a state.
- Its good idea to have lots of Functional/dumb/ stateless component whose work is to render the content to the main component.
- If you use functional component, it will be very easy for you to maintain the code in future.
## Class based vs Functional Component
- Add image here **classBasedVSfunctionalComponent**
## Component Lifecycle (Class based)
- Its only available to class based component not to functional components.
- Here are the life cycle methods
  - **1.constructor(), 2.getDerivedStateFromProps(), 3.shouldComponentUpdate(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(), componentDidUpdate(), componentDidCatch(), componentDidMount(), componentWillunmount(), render**
## Comonent Lifecycle in Different Stages

</td>
</tr>
</table> 
 
## Lifecycle when state change
- **getDerivedStateFromProps(), shouldComponentUpdate(), render(), render() child Component, componentDidUpdate()**
- 

## useEffect()
- In class components we have lifecycle methods, to perform actions in a specific lifecycle stage of our component. 
- To have something similar to that, and for us to be able to perform side effects in our functional components, the React team created the useEffect Hook.
- These are not available in functional component, to achieve this, we can use **useEffect()** in functional component
- to use use effect **imptort useEffect from 'react';**
- For more details follow this link **https://blog.logrocket.com/lifecycle-methods-with-the-useeffect-hook/**
```
useEffect(() =>{
// write your code here
});
```
- This method will execute everytime the functional component create or load or update.
### Controlling useEffect Behaviour
- If you want to execute the useEffect method when particular property update, then use this approach
- Pass the extra parameter which you get in the props. In below example we pass person as props element, when the person object change, then this method willl be execute
```
useEffect(() =>{
// write your code here
}, [props.person]);
```
- As of now we are dependeing on one value, if you want to execute this method whenever the props item change, you can pass the arguments with comma separated.
### execute this method when a component loads for first time
- Just pass empty array as argument like below
```
useEffect(() =>{
// write your code here
}, []);
```
## Cleaning up with lifecycle hook and useEffect()
- While using life cycle hook inside Class based component, use the method **componentWillUnmount()**
```
componentwillUnmount(){
// clean up code
}
```
- This method will execute when component is detached or removed from the applicaiton
- In functional component, we will do like this.
```
useEffect(() =>{
  // clean up work using useEffect()
  return () =>{
      // write your code here to clean up the code, this method will be execute when component is detached for app
  };
}, []);
```
- **NOTE** you can write as much as useEffect() inside functional component with different arguments. 
- In the above example the clean up code will execute depends upon the empty array **[]** passing as argument
- If you write like this , them useeffect will execute everytime
```
useEffect(() =>{
  // clean up work using useEffect()
  return () =>{
      // write your code here to clean up the code, this method will be execute when component is detached for app
  };
});
```
## use shouldComponentUpdate() for code effeciency and optimization 
- To check which part of the web page rendering, you can use chrome rendering tool
- Go to more tolls -> rendering -> check paint flashing
- When ever any part of the webpage update, it will highlight in green color.
- for more deails follow the code **22codeOptimizationUsingUseeffectAndmemo**
- instead of ```export default Cockpit;``` use  ```export default React.memo(Cockpit);```. It will keep the snapshot of the cockpit object
- If any part of the page, change, then only it will render again other memo will return the same cockpit object
### when should you update
- 

## Pure component instead of shouldComponentUpdate()

## How react update dom

## Rendering Adjecent JSX
- Render method will return only one element, <div>  </div>. You can not use multiple div in main root
- But you can return array of element like below
```
class Person extends Component {
  render() {
    console.log('[Person.js] rendering...');
    return (
      [
        <p key="i1" onClick={this.props.click}>
          I'm {this.props.name} and I am {this.props.age} years old!
        </p>,
        <p key="i2">{this.props.children}</p>,
        <input
          key="i3"
          type="text"
          onChange={this.props.changed}
          value={this.props.name}
        /> 
      ]
    );
  }
}
export default Person;
```
- For more details check **hoc/Aux.js and person/Person.js** in 23renderingAdjecentJSXElement project
- **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/23renderingAdjecentJSXElement**

## Using React.Fragment
- Instead of AUX in the above example, we can use built in component named **React.Fragment** which is in react package
- For this example, you can follow project named **24reactFragment/components/Person/person.js**
- **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/24reactFragment**  

## Higher Order Component
- For more details example, please check **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/25HigherOrderComponent**

## Passing Unknown Props
- **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/26passingUnkownProps**

## Setting StateCorrectly
- **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/27settingStateCorrectly**
## PropsType
- Install props types ```npm install --save prop-types```
- We can validate the prop type (string, number , array etc) we are passing to a component
- If we pass any wrong props types, we can show error.
- For example, please check Person.js file in **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/28propTypes**

## Using Refs
- Lets consider there are multiple input element, but after loading the page, you want to focus or do some action on particular input element.
- In this you can use ref to the input element and do the task.
- just check the example below
- 28
## Understanding props chain
- This can be done by using **Context API**
## useContext() and contextType
- need to clear the concept
