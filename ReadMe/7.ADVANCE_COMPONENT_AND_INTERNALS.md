# Diving Deeper into Components and ReactJs Internals

## How do debug React application
- If there is few error, it will show the error in console with line number and error message.
- Sometime due to logical error, you will not be able to check the error
- To track this error, you can put break point in source code in console of the browser
- **React Dev Tool**
  - It is used to show the details of the data in the page
  - When you will move mouse over the component in the webpage , you will see the props values in each component.
  - GO to this link **https://github.com/facebook/react-devtools**
  - Add the extension to chrome
  - You will see another tab named **react** beside console tab in inspect page
## Deeper diving into the React Internals
- In this tutorial, i will cover these topics
   - 1. Better project structure
   - 2. Splitting App into component
   - 3. Stateless vs stateful component comparison
   - 4. Class based vs Functional Component
   - 5. Component Lifecycle
   
## Better Project Structure
  - App.js is a component which contains other logic like rendering list of person
  - A container should not render all these things.
  - We can move that logic to another component named persons.js
  - The folder structure should be like this
  - **src**
    - **assets** - It will contains all images and fonts etc
    - **component** - It will contain all the components
      - **person** - This will comtain specific components related to person
    - **container**
      - App.js, App.css
   - **Cockpit**
    - Cockpit.js
- To see the project stucture and how to manage code please follow the project **17structureProject**   

### Comparing Stateless and Statefull components
- A component which maintain state is known as Statefull component
- A class based component by default known as statefull component unless it maintains a state
- A functional component can be also statefull component if it maintains a state.
- Its good idea to have lots of Functional/dumb/ stateless component whose work is to render the content to the main component.
- If you use functional component, it will be very easy for you to maintain the code in future.
## Class based vs Functional Component
- Add image here **classBasedVSfunctionalComponent**
## Component Lifecycle (Class based)
- Its only available to class based component not to functional components.
- Here are the life cycle methods
  - **1.constructor(), 2.getDerivedStateFromProps(), 3.shouldComponentUpdate(), getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(), componentDidUpdate(), componentDidCatch(), componentDidMount(), componentWillunmount(), render**
### Comonent Creation Lifecycle

- For practical example follow **18createComponentLifeCycle**

### Component Update Lifecycle
