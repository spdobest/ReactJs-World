# Multipage feeling in a single page APP (ROUTING) 
**https://reactrouter.com/web/example/basic**
- **Routing** is being able to show different screens to user.
- Multiple pages in a single page application**SPA**.
- This concept is one of the most **IMPORTANT** concept in react.

## Routing set up
- For routing set up, go to the source code **35**
- Check the render method inside Blog.js. check the styling in Blog.css

## Setting up the router Package
- install react router package ``npm install --save react-router react-router-dom``
- We installed both react-router  and react-router-dom . Technically, only react-router-dom  is required for web development. It wraps react-router  and therefore uses it as a dependency. 
- We don't need to install react-router  on our own for it to work. You can omit this installation step, I left it in there for historic reasons and because I like to emphasize that the main package is named react-router. If you ever search for assistance, you probably want to search for "react router" - that's the name of the package.

## Basics of Routing
- The Route component is perhaps the most important component in React Router to understand and learn to use well. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when its path matches the current URL.
```
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";

    ReactDOM.render(
      <Router>
        <div>
          <Route exact path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/news">
            <NewsFeed />
          </Route>
        </div>
      </Router>,
      node
    );
```
- for more details, follow **https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Route**
- 

## Preparing the project for Routing
- first import **BrowserRouter** in App.js  ```import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';```
- Now use **Route** component fro  react-router to make the routing
```
    import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    {/* <Route path="/" exact render={() => <h1>Home</h1>} />
                    <Route path="/" render={() => <h1>Home 2</h1>} /> */}
                    <Route path="/" exact component={Posts} />
                    <Route path="/new-post" component={NewPost} />
```
- If you mention ``/`` in path, then it will redirect to the home page
- In the above example, you can see, there are 2 attributes in Route, 1. Path, and second one is component. That means whe component will load
- One more parameter is there **exact** 
- **Link** tag is used to create link to redirect to another page
```
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li> <Link to="/">Home </Link> </li>
       <li> <Link to={{
          pathname: '/new-post',
          hash: '#submit',
          search: '?quick-submit = true'
       }}></Link> </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```
- In the second Link, we trying to load dtnamic page depanding the page we clicked
