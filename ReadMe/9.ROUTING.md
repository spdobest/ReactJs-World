# Multipage feeling in a single page APP (ROUTING) 
**https://reactrouter.com/web/example/basic**
- **Routing** is being able to show different screens to user.
- Multiple pages in a single page application**SPA**.
- This concept is one of the most **IMPORTANT** concept in react.

## Routing set up
- For routing set up, go to the source code **35**
- Check the render method inside Blog.js. check the styling in Blog.css

## Setting up the router Package
- install react router package ``npm install --save react-router react-router-dom``
- We installed both react-router  and react-router-dom . Technically, only react-router-dom  is required for web development. It wraps react-router  and therefore uses it as a dependency. 
- We don't need to install react-router  on our own for it to work. You can omit this installation step, I left it in there for historic reasons and because I like to emphasize that the main package is named react-router. If you ever search for assistance, you probably want to search for "react router" - that's the name of the package.

## Basics of Routing
- The Route component is perhaps the most important component in React Router to understand and learn to use well. Its most basic responsibility is to render some UI when its path matches the current URL.
```
    import React from "react";
    import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
    import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from "react-router-dom";

    ReactDOM.render(
      <Router>
        <div>
          <Route exact path="/">
            <Home />
          </Route>
          <Route path="/news">
            <NewsFeed />
          </Route>
        </div>
      </Router>,
      node
    );
```
- **Route** - 
```<Route path="/" exact render={() => <h1>Home</h1>}/>
or
`<Route path="/" exact component={Home}/>
```
- Above exact means it should match the path given if you dont add this then default value is false
- Here path is nothing but the page we defined above
- We can use render or component 
- **Link to** - is same as ```<a href="/"/>```. You need to pass the path you want to load, on the basis of the value you will pass, you can differentiate using switch.
- Link has different parameters like **pathname, hash, search**. we will discuss in details
- **switch**-
- **
- for more details, follow **https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Route**
## Passing Props in routing
```
<Route
 exact
 path="/movie/:name?/:type?"
 component={MultipleParamsChild}
/>
```
- This is the component where we will access the props
```
import React from 'react';
    const MultipleParamsChild = (props) =>{
        return(
            <div>
                <h2>Parameter 1 =  {props.match.params.name}</h2>
                <h2>Parameter2 = {props.match.params.type}</h2>
             </div>
        )
    }
    export default MultipleParamsChild;
```
## withRouter
- You can get access to the history objectâ€™s properties and the closest <Route>'s match via the withRouter higher-order component. 
- withRouter will pass updated match, location, and history props to the wrapped component whenever it renders.
- For example lets consider, we load Post component (with different parameters) in App.js. But we can not access the parameters passed
- We can access the parameters, instead of ```export default Post``` use ```export default withRouter(Post)```
- Print the props you passed in the Post component, you will see all the values

## Absolute Paths
- By default, if you just enter to="/some-path"  or to="some-path" , that's an absolute path. 
- Absolute path means that it's always appended right after your domain. Therefore, both syntaxes (with and without leading slash) lead to example.com/some-path .
## Relative Paths
- Sometimes, you might want to create a relative path instead. This is especially useful, if your component is already loaded given a specific path (e.g. posts ) and you then want to append something to that existing path (so that you, for example, get /posts/new ).
- If you're on a component loaded via /posts , to="new"  would lead to example.com/new , NOT example.com/posts/new . 
- To change this behavior, you have to find out which path you're on and add the new fragment to that existing path. You can do that with the url  property of props.match :
- <Link to={props.match.url + '/new'}>  will lead to example.com/posts/new  when placing this link in a component loaded on /posts . If you'd use the same <Link>  in a component loaded via /all-posts , the link would point to /all-posts/new .
- There's no better or worse way of creating Link paths - choose the one you need. Sometimes, you want to ensure that you always load the same path, no matter on which path you already are => Use absolute paths in this scenario.
- Use relative paths if you want to navigate relative to your existing path.

## Preparing the project for Routing
- first import **BrowserRouter** in App.js  ```import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';```
- Now use **Route** component fro  react-router to make the routing
```
    import { Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
    {/* <Route path="/" exact render={() => <h1>Home</h1>} />
                    <Route path="/" render={() => <h1>Home 2</h1>} /> */}
                    <Route path="/" exact component={Posts} />
                    <Route path="/new-post" component={NewPost} />
```
- If you mention ``/`` in path, then it will redirect to the home page
- In the above example, you can see, there are 2 attributes in Route, 1. Path, and second one is component. That means whe component will load
- One more parameter is there **exact** 
- **Link** tag is used to create link to redirect to another page
```
<header>
  <nav>
    <ul>
      <li> <Link to="/">Home </Link> </li>
       <li> <Link to={{
          pathname: '/new-post',
          hash: '#submit',
          search: '?quick-submit = true'
       }}></Link> </li>
    </ul>
  </nav>
</header>
```
- In the second Link, we trying to load dtnamic page depanding the page we clicked
