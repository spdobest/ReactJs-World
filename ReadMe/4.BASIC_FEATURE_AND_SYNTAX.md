# Understaing Base Feature and Syntax 
## JSX
- is NOT HTML but it looks a lot like it. Differences can be seen when looking closely though (for example className in JSX vs class in "normal HTML"). JSX is just syntactic sugar for JavaScript, allowing you to write HTMLish code instead of nested React.createElement(...) calls.  
- JSX stands for JavaScript XML. JSX allows us to write HTML in React. 
- JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.
- When creating components, you have the choice between two different ways:  
  - **1.Functional components** (also referred to as "presentational", "dumb" or "stateless" components - more about this later in the course) =>   
        ``` const cmp = () => { return <div>some JSX</div> }   ```     
  - (using ES6 arrow functions as shown here is recommended but optional)      
  
  - **2.class-based components** (also referred to as "containers", "smart" or "stateful" components) =>   
        ```
        class Cmp extends Component { 
        render () { 
           return <div>some JSX</div> 
           } } 
        ```  
### Why JSX 
- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.
## Embeding Expression in XML
- ```
      const name = 'Josh Perez';
      const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;

      ReactDOM.render(
        element,
        document.getElementById('root')
      );
  ```  
- To know more about JSX follow the below Links
  - https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html
  - https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html
- Below code is XMl Based Code
  - ```
        import React from 'react';
        import logo from './logo.svg';
        import './App.css';

        function App() {
          return (
            <div className="App">
               <h1> Hi, Welcome to React JS </h1>
            </div>
          );
        }
        export default App;
  ```
- THis can be converted to JSX based code like below
  - ```
        import React from 'react';
        import logo from './logo.svg';
        import './App.css';

        function App() {
          return (
            return React.CreateElement('div', {className: 'App'}, React.CreateElement('h1', 'null', 'Hi, Welcome to React JS'));
          );
        }
        export default App;
  ```
- Inside return statement in abve code, only one root element can be used, we can not use multiple element like <div> </div> <div> </div> combinely.
- The above code will show error if we use multiple element as root element.
## React Component  
- Components are the core building block of React apps. Actually, React really is just a library for creating components in its core.  
- A typical React app therefore could be depicted as a component tree - having one root component ("App") and then a potentially infinite amount of nested child components.  
- Each component needs to return/ render some JSX code - it defines which HTML code React should render to the real DOM in the end.  
- We can create components in two ways
  - **1. Class Based Component**
  - **2. Functional Component**
- Class Based Component
```
import React from 'react';
import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
 return (
    <div className="App">
       <h1> Hi, Welcome to React JS </h1>
       <p> This is another Paragraph</p>
    </div>
 );
}
export default App;
```
- Functional Component
  - We create functional component when we want to use the class as Model class
  - Create a js file named Person.js
  ```
    import React from 'react';
    
    const person = () =>{
       return <p> I'm A person </p>
    };
    export default person;
    ```  
  - We can use the above class by importing the class in app.js ```like import Person from './person/person'```
  - Then use <Person> tag inside the app.js file like <p> and <h> tags.
  
## Props  and State   
**props  and state**  are CORE concepts of React. Actually, only changes in props  and/ or state  trigger React to re-render your components and potentially update the DOM in the browser (a detailed look at how React checks whether to really touch the real DOM is provided in section 6).  
  
### Props 
- **props**  allow you to pass data from a parent (wrapping) component to a child (embedded) component.  
- Example:
```   
  import React from 'react';
  const person2 = (props) =>{
    return (
        <div> 
            <h1>Title is : {props.children}</h1>
            <p> My name is {props.name} and my age is {props.age} </p>
         </div>   
      )
  };
  export default person2;
  ```  
- You can use this function component inside app.js file as a tag. ```<Person2 name="Siba" age='28'>```  
- We can pass the title like this as well, which we can define inside person2.js file as props.children.
- ```<Person2 name="Siba" age='28'>My Name And Age details</Person2>``` The content inside the person2 tag will display as title in app.js file.
- Here, title  is the custom property (prop ) set up on the custom Post  component. We basically replicate the default HTML attribute behavior we already know (e.g. <input type="text">  informs the browser about how to handle that input).   
- The Post  component receives the props  argument. You can of course name this argument whatever you want - it's your   function definition, React doesn't care!
  
### State  
- Every class have properties which are stored by using variable.
- **state** is a keyword in React Js which only can be used inside classes that extends Component (Class Based Component). Not in functional Component.
- How to define state in React Class Based Component
```
class StateApp extends Component {
    state = {
        persons : [
            {name: 'Siba', age: 32},
            {name: 'Prasad', age: 31},
            {name: 'Silu', age: 30},
            {name: 'Ravu', age: 29},
            {name: 'Shyam', age: 28}
        ],
        myTitle: 'Another variable inside state'
    }
    switchHandler = () =>{
         console.log('Switch handler Clicked');
    } 
    render(){
        return (
            <div>  
                <h1> Title is : {this.state.myTitle} </h1>
                <button onClick={this.switchHandler}>Switch Name</button>
                <Person name="Sibaprasad" age="32">My Details</Person>
                <Person name={this.state.persons[0].name} age={this.state.persons[0].age}/>
                <Person name={this.state.persons[1].name} age={this.state.persons[1].age}/>
                <Person name={this.state.persons[2].name} age={this.state.persons[2].age}/>
                <Person name={this.state.persons[3].name} age={this.state.persons[3].age}/> 
            </div>
        )
    };
} 
export default StateApp;
```
- Above class we define array of person class inside the state and also another variable named myTitle.
- By using ```{this.state.persons[0].name} and {this.state.myTitle}``` we can access the data declared inside the state of the class.
- In the above example we have handled the click event by calling a function named switchHandler. It is a arrow function.
- We can access this function with the help of this keyword.
- Whilst props allow you to pass data down the component tree (and hence trigger an UI update), state is used to change the component, well, state from within. Changes to state also trigger an UI update.  
- To update the state , there is a method name called setState({}). and pass the json object as argument.
- It will merge the value with the existing state value
```
 state = {
        persons : [
            {name: 'Siba', age: 32},
            {name: 'Prasad', age: 31},
            {name: 'Silu', age: 30},
            {name: 'Ravu', age: 29},
            {name: 'Shyam', age: 28}
        ],
        myTitle: 'Another variable inside state'
    }
    
    switchHandler = () =>{
         console.log('Switch handler Clicked');
         this.setState(
         {
          persons : [
            {name: 'SibaPrasad', age: 32},
            {name: 'Prasad', age: 31},
            {name: 'Silu', age: 30},
            {name: 'Ravu', age: 29},
            {name: 'Shyam', age: 28}
        ],
        myTitle: 'Another variable inside state',
        otherValue: 123
    }
         );
    } 
``` 
- In the above example, the jsob object we are passing to setState method, it will compare with the object existing in state.
- It will merge the value in state.
- Now i have added, ```otherValue: 1123```. it will added inside the state object.
Example:   
NewPost Component:  
 ``` 
class NewPost extends Component { // state can only be accessed in class-based components!  
    state = {  
        counter: 1  
    };    
   
    render () { // Needs to be implemented in class-based components! Needs to return some JSX!  
        return (  
            <div>{this.state.counter}</div>  
        );  
    }  
}
``` 
- Here, the NewPost  component contains state . Only class-based components can define and use state . 
- You can of course pass the state  down to functional components, but these then can't directly edit it.  
- state  simply is a property of the component class, you have to call it state  though - the name is not optional. You can then access it via this.state  in your class JSX code (which you return in the required render()  method).  
- Whenever state  changes (taught over the next lectures), the component will re-render and reflect the new state. The difference to props  is, that this happens within one and the same component - you don't receive new data (props ) from    outside!  
  
## To Which Events Can You Listen?  
In the last lecture, we saw that you can react to the onClick event - but to which other events can you listen? You can find a list of supported events here:

## Function Components Naming  
- In the next lecture, we'll learn how to manage state in functional components (instead of class-based components).  
- In case you're getting an error with the code shown in the next lecture, simply assign a capitalized variable name to the   variable that holds your functional component.  

## React Hook (useState)
- UseState is inside react package and used as react Hook to maintain the state like state in above
- This is like function
- import useState like this ```import React,{useState} from 'react'; ```
```
const ReactHookApp = props =>{

    const [personsState,setPersonStateArray] = useState(
        {
            persons : [
                {name: 'Siba', age: 32},
                {name: 'Prasad', age: 31},
                {name: 'Silu', age: 30},
                {name: 'Ravu', age: 29},
                {name: 'Shyam', age: 28}
            ],
            otherState: 'Some Other state',
            count: 0
        }
    );
    }
    
    const [otherState,setOtherState] = useState('Some Other value');
    
export default   ReactHookApp;  
```
- Above we have define state of the class inside the useState function. There are 2 paremeters inside [ ], first one is to access the datainside the persons array and the second variable is used to update the data inside the persons array.
- When you update persons array using ```setPersonStateArray({ persons : [{name: 'SibaPrasad', age: 32}])```.
- This will not merge the array we passed, it will replace the persons array. Now the persons array have only one element.
- The above concept is **React Hook**. This is used inside the Function based component not class based component.
- If you want to use Class based component, then use state mentioned above.
## useReducer (Another React Hook)
- The useReducer hook also can be used to update state, but it does so in a more sophisticated way: it accepts a reducer function and an initial state, and it returns the actual state and a dispatch function. 
- The dispatch function alters state in an implicit way by mapping actions to state transitions:
- For more details follow **https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-usereducer-vs-usestate**
- Counter App example using **useReducer**
```
import React, { useReducer } from 'react';
 
const counterReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count + 1 };
    case 'DECREASE':
      return { ...state, count: state.count - 1 };
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
};
 
const Counter = () => {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(counterReducer, { count: 0 });
 
  const handleIncrease = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'INCREASE' });
  };
 
  const handleDecrease = () => {
    dispatch({ type: 'DECREASE' });
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter with useReducer</h1>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <div>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleIncrease}>
          +
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleDecrease}>
          -
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Counter;
```
- Counter App example using **useState**
```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
 
const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 
  const handleIncrease = () => {
    setCount(count => count + 1);
  };
 
  const handleDecrease = () => {
    setCount(count => count - 1);
  };
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Counter with useState</h1>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <div>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleIncrease}>
          +
        </button>
        <button type="button" onClick={handleDecrease}>
          -
        </button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
export default Counter;
```
## Statefull vs stateless component.
- **Statefull**
  - The components which maintains state is known as statefull component.
  - In Statefull component, you can maintain state using ReactHook ( **useState()** ) or react state (**state**).
  - In Above example ReactHookApp, App class are statefull component
- **Stateless or Presentational or Dumb Component**
  - The React Component which don't maintain state is known as stateless component.
  
## Passing method reference to Component
- We can pass method reference to functional component using **props** same as we pass variables.
- Here is the code snippet to explore this concept
```
<Person 
  click={this.switchHandler.bind(this,'Sibaprasad Mohanty', 55)} 
  name={this.state.persons[1].name} 
  age={this.state.persons[1].age}/>
```
- We can use arrow function on button click but this is ineffecient
```
<button onClick={ () => this.switchHandler('Button Click Name', 55)} >Switch Name</button>
```
- Instead of the above code, its preferable to use below syntax using bind
```<button onClick={this.switchHandler.bind(this,'Button Click Name', 55)} >Switch Name</button>```
- inside peron.js class just write like this
```
const Person = (props) =>{
    return(
        <div>
            <p>{props.children}</p>
            <p onClick={props.click}> My name is {props.name} and age is {props.age}</p> 
    </div>    
    )
}
export default Person;
```
## Two way data binding
- Lets consider, there will be an input element where user can enter his name, then the name should be update in state. It will automatically uupdate
- We can do same as above, but we can pass the value using event from the text field
```
onNameChange = (event) =>{
 console.log('Switch handler Clicked');
 this.setState( {
   persons : [ {name: event.target.value, age: 123}],
   myTitle: 'Another variable inside state',
   count: 0
     }
  )
} 
```
- The person class will be like this
```
const Person = (props) =>{
    return(
        <div>
            <p>{props.children}</p>
            <p onClick={props.click}> My name is {props.name} and age is {props.age}</p> 
            <input type='text' placeholder='Name' onChange={props.onNameChange} value = {props.name}/>
            <input type='text' placeholder='Age' onChange={props.onAgeChange} />
    </div>    
    )
}
```

## Styling the component
- Here we will style the Person component using style sheet and css file
- Create a Person.css file inside the same package and define the styles you need 
```
.Person{
    width: 60%;
    margin: auto;
    border: 1px solid #eeeeee;
    box-shadow: 0 2px 3px #ccc;
    padding: 16px;
    text-align: center;
}
```
- In Person.js file just import this file, style will be added to all Person component
```
import './Person.css'

const Person = (props) =>{
    return(
        <div className='Person'>
            <p>{props.children}</p>
            <p onClick={props.click}> My name is {props.name} and age is {props.age}</p> 
            <input type='text' placeholder='Name' onChange={props.onNameChange} value = {props.name}/>
            <input type='text' placeholder='Age' onChange={props.onAgeChange}  value = {props.age}/>
    </div>    
    )
}
export default Person;
```
- Define the div class name as Person.
## Working with Inline style
- Without defining style in style.css file and apply the style to any component
- By inline style, we will create style inside js file and apply the style to the component
- Inside render method define style like this
```
const style = {
  backgroundColor: 'white',
  font: 'inherit',
  border: '1px solid blue',
  padding: '8px',
  cursor: 'pointer'
  };
  
  <button 
     style={style}>Switch Name</button>
                    
```
