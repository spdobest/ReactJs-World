- Redux is a third party library which is used to maintain state
- Its very hard to maintain state of components manually

## What is state
- State is nothing but the data contains by any component
- Lets consider, if we add multiple items in a cart and we will load the cart page, the data stored there. these are the state of the Component
- For user authentication, wether the user is authenticated or not we save one value all over the application, that is state

- In the above example, you can see there is lots of information need by all over the application
- In this case, its become very difficult to maintain the state. We can use some Javascript file to save all the data over there and import this file and use those variables in the required Component.
- To overcome this problem **Redux** is the better solution for State Management all over the application.
## Understanding Redux flow
