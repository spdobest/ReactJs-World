# Redux (4.0.5) 
- **https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial** 
- Redux is a third party library which is used to maintain state
- Its very hard to maintain state of components manually
- Redux is a state container for JavaScript apps. It is most commonly paired with React, where it takes control of state away from React components and gives it to a centralised place called a ‘store’. 
## Install Redux
- npm i redux react-redux 
- Install redux **npm i redux** (This is fo)
## What is state
- State is nothing but the data contains by any component
- Lets consider, if we add multiple items in a cart and we will load the cart page, the data stored there. these are the state of the Component
- For user authentication, wether the user is authenticated or not we save one value all over the application, that is state

- In the above example, you can see there is lots of information need by all over the application
- In this case, its become very difficult to maintain the state. We can use some Javascript file to save all the data over there and import this file and use those variables in the required Component.
- To overcome this problem **Redux** is the better solution for State Management all over the application.

- Redux maintain a Central store - It stores entire application state
- <img src=https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/blob/master/Images/reduxFlow.png width="700" height="400"/>  
- **Let me explain the Redux flow in details (Counter App)**
  - Counter app is simple app, there is 2 buttons one is **+** and another is **-**. When user will click on the **+** the counter will increase and it will update counter text in another component.
  - **Central Store**- Where all the global data stored using the component named **store**
  - **Component** - When user will click on **+**,it will pass the action name with data( Here we no need to pass the data, but for todo app, when user will add another todo item, then you need to pass the todo item to the action)
  - **Action** Here lots of action's will be declared as per the requirement. For counter app there 2 actions **ADD & REMOVE**. 
  - This action will be pass to reducer which is connected to central store. Action with data will be send to reducer from Component. So **Action** is a messenger between Component and Reducer.
  - **Reducer** Now reduccer will update the value in central store as per the action received.
  - **central Store**- Now the central store data will be update and Trigger a change in value. So that whatever components Subscribed and observing to the change in central store data. These component will be notified and in the component the new value will be update.

**Step 1: UI (User Interface)**
- This is where a change is triggered. For example, a user clicking a ‘+’ button in a simple counter app.
  
**Step 2: Actions**
- The actual action we want to take place, for example, “add one”.
- In Redux, actions are plain JavaScript objects, and they must have a type property (e.g. 'ADD_ONE' ).
  
**Step 3: Reducer**
- These specify how the application’s state should change in response to each action. For example, our new state should be one integer higher than our old state. (It is reducers which give Redux its name — they share the same Latin root).
  
**Step 4A: Store**
- The store brings everything together. It holds application state, and it is where you will find three critical methods:
- **getState()** — which allows access to the state object
- **dispatch(action)** — which allows state to be updated
- **subscribe(listener)** — which registers listeners, allowing code to trigger every time a change takes place
  
**Step 4B: State**
- Finally, state is contained within the store. It is a concept you should be familiar with from React. In short, it is an object that represents the dynamic parts of the app: anything that may change on the client-side.
- In our example of a counter app, the state object will contain whatever number our counter is on. This change is then communicated back to the UI, where it will appear to the user.
## Addition Concepts used in Redux
- **Boilerplate:**
    - sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. One of the reasons Redux can seem tricky to beginners is because it contains more boilerplate than you’re likely used to for front-end development.
- **Payload:**
    - the conventional name used for the property that holds the actual data in a Redux action object. A payload isn’t necessary, but it’s fairly common to see actions defined like this:
```
const ADD_USER = {
  type: "ADD_USER",
  payload: {name: "John Smith", age: 45},
}
```
- **Middleware:** 
    - in general, middleware glues together client-side and server-side code, allowing (back-end) developers to implement logic based upon the request made from the client. In Redux, middleware provides a way to interact with actions that have been dispatched to the store before they reach the store’s reducer.
    
## Simple Count Application using redux
- File Structure of the application
  - **src**
    - **Actions**
        - action1.js
        - action2.js
    - **Components**    
      - Component1
      - Component2
    - **reducers**  
      - reducers1.js
      - reducers2.js
    - App.js
    - App.css  
    - index.js
    - store.js
- **actions.js** — for storing our app’s various actions and their definitions;
- **reducers.js** — where we define the reducers for each action;
- **store.js** — where we create our store and bring everything together.  

## Follow this example
- npm install --save redux
```
const redux  = require('redux');
const createStore  = redux.createStore;

const initialState = {
    counter: 0
}

// reducer
const rootReducer = (state = initialState,action) => {
    if(action.type === 'INC_COUNTER'){
        return {
            ...state,
            counter:state.counter+1
        };
    }
    if(action.type === 'ADD_COUNTER'){
        return {
            ...state,
            counter:state.counter+action.value
        };
    }
    return state;
};

// store
const store = createStore(rootReducer);
console.log(store.getState());


// dispatching Action 
store.dispatch({type:'INC_COUNTER'});
store.dispatch({type:'ADD_COUNTER',value:10});
console.log(store.getState());
// subscription

store.subscribe( ()=>{
    console.log('[Subscription]',store.getState());
});
```
- Now run this file using **node filename**
## Now understand the simple counter app
- file path 61

- **Step1:** Create store.js
```
import { createStore } from 'redux';

import reducer from './reducers';
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    export default store;
```
