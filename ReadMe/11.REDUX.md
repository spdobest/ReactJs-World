# Redux (4.0.5) 
- **https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial** 
- Redux is a third party library which is used to maintain state
- Its very hard to maintain state of components manually
- Redux is a state container for JavaScript apps. It is most commonly paired with React, where it takes control of state away from React components and gives it to a centralised place called a ‘store’. 
## Install Redux
- npm i redux react-redux 
- Install redux **npm i redux** (This is fo)
## What is state
- State is nothing but the data contains by any component
- Lets consider, if we add multiple items in a cart and we will load the cart page, the data stored there. these are the state of the Component
- For user authentication, wether the user is authenticated or not we save one value all over the application, that is state
- <img src=https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/blob/master/Images/reduxStateExplained.png width="700" height="400"/> 
- In the above example, you can see there is lots of information need by all over the application
- In this case, its become very difficult to maintain the state. We can use some Javascript file to save all the data over there and import this file and use those variables in the required Component.
- To overcome this problem **Redux** is the better solution for State Management all over the application.
## Understanding Redux flow

- Redux maintain a Central store - It stores entire application state
- <img src=https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/blob/master/Images/reduxFlow.png width="700" height="400"/>  
- **Let me explain the Redux flow in details (Counter App)**
  - Counter app is simple app, there is 2 buttons one is **+** and another is **-**. When user will click on the **+** the counter will increase and it will update counter text in another component.
  - **Central Store**- Where all the global data stored using the component named **store**
  - **Component** - When user will click on **+**,it will pass the action name with data( Here we no need to pass the data, but for todo app, when user will add another todo item, then you need to pass the todo item to the action)
  - **Action** Here lots of action's will be declared as per the requirement. For counter app there 2 actions **ADD & REMOVE**. 
  - This action will be pass to reducer which is connected to central store. Action with data will be send to reducer from Component. So **Action** is a messenger between Component and Reducer.
  - **Reducer** Now reduccer will update the value in central store as per the action received.
  - **central Store**- Now the central store data will be update and Trigger a change in value. So that whatever components Subscribed and observing to the change in central store data. These component will be notified and in the component the new value will be update.
- <img src=https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/blob/master/Images/reduxFlow1.png />  
**Step 1: UI (User Interface)**
- This is where a change is triggered. For example, a user clicking a ‘+’ button in a simple counter app.
  
**Step 2: Actions**
- The actual action we want to take place, for example, “add one”.
- In Redux, actions are plain JavaScript objects, and they must have a type property (e.g. 'ADD_ONE' ).
  
**Step 3: Reducer**
- These specify how the application’s state should change in response to each action. For example, our new state should be one integer higher than our old state. (It is reducers which give Redux its name — they share the same Latin root).
  
**Step 4A: Store**
- The store brings everything together. It holds application state, and it is where you will find three critical methods:
- **getState()** — which allows access to the state object
- **dispatch(action)** — which allows state to be updated
- **subscribe(listener)** — which registers listeners, allowing code to trigger every time a change takes place
  
**Step 4B: State**
- Finally, state is contained within the store. It is a concept you should be familiar with from React. In short, it is an object that represents the dynamic parts of the app: anything that may change on the client-side.
- In our example of a counter app, the state object will contain whatever number our counter is on. This change is then communicated back to the UI, where it will appear to the user.
## Addition Concepts used in Redux
- **Boilerplate:**
    - sections of code that have to be included in many places with little or no alteration. One of the reasons Redux can seem tricky to beginners is because it contains more boilerplate than you’re likely used to for front-end development.
- **Payload:**
    - the conventional name used for the property that holds the actual data in a Redux action object. A payload isn’t necessary, but it’s fairly common to see actions defined like this:
```
const ADD_USER = {
  type: "ADD_USER",
  payload: {name: "John Smith", age: 45},
}
```
- **Middleware:** 
    - in general, middleware glues together client-side and server-side code, allowing (back-end) developers to implement logic based upon the request made from the client. In Redux, middleware provides a way to interact with actions that have been dispatched to the store before they reach the store’s reducer.
    
## Simple Count Application using redux
- File Structure of the application
  - **src**
    - **Actions**
        - action1.js
        - action2.js
    - **Components**    
      - Component1
      - Component2
    - **reducers**  
      - reducers1.js
      - reducers2.js
    - App.js
    - App.css  
    - index.js
    - store.js
- **actions.js** — for storing our app’s various actions and their definitions;
- **reducers.js** — where we define the reducers for each action;
- **store.js** — where we create our store and bring everything together.  

## Follow this example
- npm install --save redux
```
const redux  = require('redux');
const createStore  = redux.createStore;

const initialState = {
    counter: 0
}

// reducer
const rootReducer = (state = initialState,action) => {
    if(action.type === 'INC_COUNTER'){
        return {
            ...state,
            counter:state.counter+1
        };
    }
    if(action.type === 'ADD_COUNTER'){
        return {
            ...state,
            counter:state.counter+action.value
        };
    }
    return state;
};

// store
const store = createStore(rootReducer);
console.log(store.getState());


// dispatching Action 
store.dispatch({type:'INC_COUNTER'});
store.dispatch({type:'ADD_COUNTER',value:10});
console.log(store.getState());
// subscription

store.subscribe( ()=>{
    console.log('[Subscription]',store.getState());
});
```
- Now run this file using **node filename**
## Now understand the simple counter app
- file path 61

- **Step1: Create store**
```
import { createStore } from 'redux';

import reducer from './reducers';
    const store = createStore(reducer);
    export default store;
```
- **step2: Create Reducer**
```
const initialState = {
    counter: 0
}
const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
        return {
            counter: state.counter + 1
        }
    }
     if (action.type === 'DECREMENT') {
        return {
            counter: state.counter + 1
        }
    }
    return state;
};

export default reducer;
```
- Now we need to connect our react app to get access to store
- For this, i need to install react-redux **npm i redux react-redux**
- It will have one component **Provider** bind your App with provider tag by passing the store object
```
import { Provider } from "react-redux"; 
import CounterReduxApp from './61reduxCounterExample/App'; 

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
<Provider store={store}>
   <CounterReduxApp />
</Provider>

</React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```
-**Step3** **connect** is a function which returns Higher order function
- Connecting store to React App
```
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
    return {
        onIncrementCounter: () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})
    };
};

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(Counter);
```
- **Step4: Dispatching Action**
```
const mapDispatchToProps = dispatch => {
    return {
        onIncrementCounter: () => dispatch({type: 'INCREMENT'})
    };
};
```
- **Step5: Now change the value and subscribe the value change to store**
```
const initialState = {
    counter: 0
}

const reducer = (state = initialState, action) => {
    
    console.log("action "+action.type+" value "+action.val);

    if (action.type === 'INCREMENT') {
        return {
            counter: state.counter + 2
        }
    }
    if (action.type === 'SUBSTRACT') {
        return {
            counter: state.counter - action.val
        }
    }
    return state;
};

export default reducer;
```
- You can have multiple Reducers, multiple actions, and multiple results as well in state.

## Updating State Immutable
```
  const newState = state;
  newState.counter = state.counter + 1;
  return newState;
```
- Instead of this we can use like this
```
return {
          ...state
          counter: state.counter + 1
       }  
```
- In the above cate state will contain all the properties and add one more property with updated value
## Immutable Object pattern
- Immutable Update Patterns on reduxjs.org: https://redux.js.org/recipes/structuring-reducers/immutable-update-patterns/
### Updating Nested Objects
- The key to updating nested data is that every level of nesting must be copied and updated appropriately. This is often a difficult concept for those learning Redux, and there are some specific problems that frequently occur when trying to update nested objects. These lead to accidental direct mutation, and should be avoided.
- **Common Mistake #1:** New variables that point to the same objects
- Defining a new variable does not create a new actual object - it only creates another reference to the same object. An example of this error would be:
```
function updateNestedState(state, action) {
    let nestedState = state.nestedState;
    // ERROR: this directly modifies the existing object reference - don't do this!
    nestedState.nestedField = action.data;
 
    return {
        ...state,
        nestedState
    };
}
```
- This function does correctly return a shallow copy of the top-level state object, but because the nestedState variable was still pointing at the existing object, the state was directly mutated.

- **Common Mistake #2:** Only making a shallow copy of one level
- Another common version of this error looks like this:
```
function updateNestedState(state, action) {
    // Problem: this only does a shallow copy!
    let newState = {...state};
 
    // ERROR: nestedState is still the same object!
    newState.nestedState.nestedField = action.data;
 
    return newState;
}
```
- Doing a shallow copy of the top level is not sufficient - the nestedState object should be copied as well.
- **Correct Approach:** Copying All Levels of Nested Data
- Unfortunately, the process of correctly applying immutable updates to deeply nested state can easily become verbose and hard to read. Here's what an example of updating state.first.second[someId].fourth might look like:
```
function updateVeryNestedField(state, action) {
    return {
        ...state,
        first : {
            ...state.first,
            second : {
                ...state.first.second,
                [action.someId] : {
                    ...state.first.second[action.someId],
                    fourth : action.someValue
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Obviously, each layer of nesting makes this harder to read, and gives more chances to make mistakes. This is one of several reasons why you are encouraged to keep your state flattened, and compose reducers as much as possible.
- **Inserting and Removing Items in Arrays**
- Normally, a Javascript array's contents are modified using mutative functions like push, unshift, and splice. Since we don't want to mutate state directly in reducers, those should normally be avoided. Because of that, you might see "insert" or "remove" behavior written like this:
```
function insertItem(array, action) {
    return [
        ...array.slice(0, action.index),
        action.item,
        ...array.slice(action.index)
    ]
}
 
function removeItem(array, action) {
    return [
        ...array.slice(0, action.index),
        ...array.slice(action.index + 1)
    ];
}
```
- However, remember that the key is that the original in-memory reference is not modified. As long as we make a copy first, we can safely mutate the copy. Note that this is true for both arrays and objects, but nested values still must be updated using the same rules.

- **This means that we could also write the insert and remove functions like this:**
```
function insertItem(array, action) {
    let newArray = array.slice();
    newArray.splice(action.index, 0, action.item);
    return newArray;
}
 
function removeItem(array, action) {
    let newArray = array.slice();
    newArray.splice(action.index, 1);
    return newArray;
}
```
- **The remove function could also be implemented as:**
```
function removeItem(array, action) {
    return array.filter( (item, index) => index !== action.index);
}
```
- **Updating an Item in an Array**
- Updating one item in an array can be accomplished by using Array.map, returning a new value for the item we want to update, and returning the existing values for all other items:
```
function updateObjectInArray(array, action) {
    return array.map( (item, index) => {
        if(index !== action.index) {
            // This isn't the item we care about - keep it as-is
            return item;
        }
 
        // Otherwise, this is the one we want - return an updated value
        return {
            ...item,
            ...action.item
        };    
    });
}
```
- **Immutable Update Utility Libraries**
- Because writing immutable update code can become tedious, there are a number of utility libraries that try to abstract out the process. These libraries vary in APIs and usage, but all try to provide a shorter and more succinct way of writing these updates. Some, like dot-prop-immutable, take string paths for commands:
- ```state = dotProp.set(state, `todos.${index}.complete`, true)```
- Others, like immutability-helper (a fork of the now-deprecated React Immutability Helpers addon), use nested values and helper functions:
```
var collection = [1, 2, {a: [12, 17, 15]}];
var newCollection = update(collection, {2: {a: {$splice: [[1, 1, 13, 14]]}}});
```
- They can provide a useful alternative to writing manual immutable update logic.
