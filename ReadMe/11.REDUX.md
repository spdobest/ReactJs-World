# Redux (4.0.5) 
- **https://react-redux.js.org/introduction/basic-tutorial**
- Redux is a third party library which is used to maintain state
- Its very hard to maintain state of components manually
- Redux is a state container for JavaScript apps. It is most commonly paired with React, where it takes control of state away from React components and gives it to a centralised place called a ‘store’.
- Install redux **npm i redux**
## What is state
- State is nothing but the data contains by any component
- Lets consider, if we add multiple items in a cart and we will load the cart page, the data stored there. these are the state of the Component
- For user authentication, wether the user is authenticated or not we save one value all over the application, that is state

- In the above example, you can see there is lots of information need by all over the application
- In this case, its become very difficult to maintain the state. We can use some Javascript file to save all the data over there and import this file and use those variables in the required Component.
- To overcome this problem **Redux** is the better solution for State Management all over the application.

- Redux maintain a Central store - It stores entire application state

**Step 1: UI (User Interface)**
- This is where a change is triggered. For example, a user clicking a ‘+’ button in a simple counter app.
  
**Step 2: Actions**
- The actual action we want to take place, for example, “add one”.
- In Redux, actions are plain JavaScript objects, and they must have a type property (e.g. 'ADD_ONE' ).
  
**Step 3: Reducer**
- These specify how the application’s state should change in response to each action. For example, our new state should be one integer higher than our old state. (It is reducers which give Redux its name — they share the same Latin root).
  
**Step 4A: Store**
- The store brings everything together. It holds application state, and it is where you will find three critical methods:
- **getState()** — which allows access to the state object
- **dispatch(action)** — which allows state to be updated
- **subscribe(listener)** — which registers listeners, allowing code to trigger every time a change takes place
  
**Step 4B: State**
- Finally, state is contained within the store. It is a concept you should be familiar with from React. In short, it is an object that represents the dynamic parts of the app: anything that may change on the client-side.
- In our example of a counter app, the state object will contain whatever number our counter is on. This change is then communicated back to the UI, where it will appear to the user.
