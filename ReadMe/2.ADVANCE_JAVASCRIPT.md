# Next Generation Javascript 
- Here we will explore the advance concepts in javascript is going to widely used in React js development.
### Arrow Function
- normal function
- ```
      function printMyname(name){
        console.log(`My Name is  ${name}`);
      }
      printMyname('siba');
  ```   
- Now we will convert the functions to arrow function like this.
- ```
      const printName = name => console.log(`My Name is  ${name}`);
      printName('prasad');
  ```
  
### import and Export
- **EXPORT**
- Lets create a person.js fiee
- ```
      const person = {
        name: ‘Siba’
      }
      export default person;
  ````
    
- here we are exporting this person class and we can import this class in somewhere else
- we can export multiple things at a time like this
- Create a Utility.js file 
- ```
      export const clean () =>{…}
      export const baseData = 32
  ```
-**IMPORT** 
- we can import other js files into another js file by using the import keyword
- ```
    import person from ‘/js/person’
    or
    import prs from ‘/js/person’  // this is nothing but the path of the person.js file
  ```
- Now we can use the variable person or pro in our class
- If we want to import multiple things from a single js file, here is how we will do it
- ```
    import {clean} from ‘/js/utility’
    import {baseData} from ‘/js/utility’
  ```
- We can use curly brackets to export the particular variable and functions. You must use the particular function name or variable name inside the curly bracket that inside the class it contains.
- You can use clean as different variable name in the class you will use
- ```
    import {clean as cln}  from ‘/js/utility’
    import {baseData as bsedata}  from ‘/js/utility’
   ``` 
### Understating classes
- Class in javascript, you can create class using class keyword and can  create object using new keyword same as in java.
- use the constructor keyword and define all the properties you want and mention as this.variablename = value
- You can define methods( without function keyword), properties inside class.
- ```
    class Human{
        constructor(){
          this.gender = 'Male'
        }
        printGender(){
          console.log(`Gender is ${this.gender}`)
        }
      }

      class Person extends Human {
         constructor(){
           super();
          this.name = 'Sibaprasad'
          this.gender = 'female'
        }
        printName(){
          console.log(`Name is ${this.name}`)
        }
      }

      const person = new Person()
      person.printName()
      person.printGender()

  ```
- You can extend another class using the  extends keyword and you have to put the super(); call inside the child class constructor
- Now in es 7 there are lot of changes
- NO need to define this keyword for the parameter that we passing
- Now properties are like variables in ES 7
  
- The above code will changes to something like this
- ``` class Human{
          gender = 'Male'
            printGender = () => {
              console.log(`Gender is ${this.gender}`)
            }
          }

      class Person extends Human {
          name = 'Sibaprasad'
          gender = 'female'
        printName = () => {
          console.log(`Name is ${this.name}`)
        }
      }
      const person = new Person()
      person.printName()
      person.printGender()
  ``` 
  
### Spread Operator
It is used to split up array elements or object properties
- ```
        const array = [1,2,3]
        const newArray=[…array,4,5,6]

        const array = [1,2,3]
        const newArray = [...array,4,5,6]

        console.log(newArray);

        // now for object
        const person = {
          name:'Siba'
        };

        const newPerson = {
          ...person,
          age: 28
        };

        console.log(newPerson);
    ```
## Rest Operator
- Here is a small example of spread operator
- ```
    const filter = (...args) =>{
      return args.filter(el => el===1)
    }

    console.log(filter(1,2,3,4,1,2,1))

    OUTPUT IS : [1, 1, 1]
  ```
  
### Destructuring
- Easily extract array elements or object properties and store them in variables
- Array Destructuring
- ```
        [a,b] = [‘’Hello,’ Siba’]
        console.log(a); // Hello
        console.log(b); // Siba

        const num = [1,2,3]
        const [num1,,num2] = num

        console.log(num1,num2);

        output is 1 3
    ```
    
- Object Destructuring
- ``` {name} = {name: ‘Max’, age: 28}
      console.log(name)// Max
      console.log(age)// undefined
   ```   
### Primitive And referent type
- ```const person = {
	      name: ’siba’
      } 
        const secondPerson = person
        person.name = ‘Prasad’
        console.log(secondPerson); // in this case it will print prasad.
    ```
- Because, while creating name field inside person object, it will create a pointer to and assign in the person object
- when we assign secondPerson = person, it will copy the the reference of the person object.
- if we change the content inside the person object, eventually the second person will also change
 
- Look at the below example
- ```const person = {
	      name: ’siba’
      };
      
      const secondPerson= {
	        …person
        };
        person.name = ‘Prasad’

      console.log(secondPerson); it will print siba, not prasad. Because in the above case it will copy all the content of person object to secondPerson

    ```  
    
### Refreshing Array Function
- ```
        const numArray = [1,2,3];
        const doublenumArray = numArray(num) =>{
          return num * 2;
        }

        console.log(numArray);
        console.log(doublenumArray);
    ```
## JS Array Functions
- Not really next-gen JavaScript, but also important: JavaScript array functions like map() , filter() , reduce()  etc.
- You'll see me use them quite a bit since a lot of React concepts rely on working with arrays (in immutable ways).
- The following page gives a good overview over the various methods you can use on the array prototype -
