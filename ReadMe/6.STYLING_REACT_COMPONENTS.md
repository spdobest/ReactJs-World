# Styling ReactJs Component and Elements 
- In this tutorial, we will cover the styling of component using simple CSS, Inline css, other third party library
- We can apply style conditinally
- we can programmatically change the class name to which style can be applied.

## Radium 
- Radium is a set of tools to manage inline styles on React elements. It gives you powerful styling capabilities without CSS.
- To install Radium 
```npm i radium``` or ```npm install --save radium```

## Styled Component
- This is another library to style the components
- For more details visit **https://styled-components.com/**
- To install the lib use ```npm install --save styled-components```
- This library has all the styled components that are in HTML. we can just use styled.div`your style`.
- Similarly we can use other element as well, styled.h1, styled.p etc
- For example Follow the project **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/14styledComponent**
-**Though its very easy and good library to implement, but its mixing the js and css code in one file, so sometime its really confusing**
- For the above reason, its not recomended to use Styled Component.
