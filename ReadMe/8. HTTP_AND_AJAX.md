# Reaching Out to the WEB (HTTP and AJAX) 
- We will cover how to make network call in react js
- Fetch data from server to client.

## Understanding HTTP Request in react js
- IN React js if you send a http request, in return you will not get a html page in response
- You will get json response, you need to parse that data to html page

## project setup
- install axious **npm install axios --save**
- **axios** is a library used to make network call.
- For more details follow the link **https://github.com/axios/axios**
- For project setup follor this project here **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/30httpRequest**
- **NOTE:** componentDidMount() method is the best place to make the HTTP request.
## How to handle GET request
```
componentDidMount(){
  axios.get("url to fetch data")
    .then( response =>{
        console.log(response);
    })
}
```
- How to store the response inside state
```
state = {
  posts = [];
}

componentDidMount(){
  axios.get("url to fetch data")
    .then( response =>{
    this.setState({posts: response.data});
        console.log(response);
    })
}
```
- Now use the **this.state.posts.map()** to render the data to the UI
- For example, follow the project here **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/31getRequest**
## How to handle post methods
- **https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/32postRequestAndErrorHandling**
## How to handle Delete methods

## How to handle error locally
- https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/33setUpGlobalConfig
```
componentDidMount(){
  axios.get("url to fetch data")
    .then( response =>{
    this.setState({posts: response.data});
        console.log(response);
    })
    .catch( error =>{
        console.log(error);
        // update a boolean which will be true here and the error component will be display
        this.setState({error: true});
    });
}
```
## Adding interceptors in request
- If we want to pass come patemeters to every request we are sending, then we need interceptors to do these stuffs
- We can pass common header, authToken etc.
- This can be done by **axious.interceptors**
```
import axios from 'axios';
axios.interceptor.request.use( request =>{
  console.log(request);
  // edit the request config to pass other parameters
  return request;
},
error =>{
  console.log(error);
  // we can handle the error here
  return Promise.reject(error);
});
```
- After adding this code, just make http request, you will able to see what parameters we are passing while sending request
- In the error part above, if there is no internet connection, then it will comes in error section, from here we can show some message
## interceptor for response
- As we did for request in above, same thing can be done in response as well.
```
axios.interceptor.response.use( response =>{
  console.log(response);
  // edit the response data
  return response;
},
error =>{
  console.log(error);
  // we can handle the error here
  return Promise.reject(error);
});
```
- **Note: we can use intereceptor to pass common header, authorization key etc**
## How to remove interecetor 
- You learned how to add an interceptor, getting rid of one is also easy. Simply store the reference to the interceptor in a variable and call eject  with that reference as an argument, to remove it
```
var myInterceptor = axios.interceptors.request.use(function () {/*...*/});
axios.interceptors.request.eject(myInterceptor);
```

## How to setup global configuration for all the request 
- follor 33
## How to set up different url for different requests in one application
- In some of the project, sometime we need different request url to send request
- This can be solved by using one of the axios cool feature called **instances**
- Create a file named **axios.js**
```
import axios from 'axios';

const instance = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'www.baseurl.com/asdf/';
}); 

instance.defaults.header.common['Authorization'] = 'AUTH TOKEN FROM';

export default instance;
```
- Now use this class all other places 
- For the exammple, go throught the code**https://github.com/spdobest/ReactJs-World/tree/master/programs/src/34axiosInstances**
